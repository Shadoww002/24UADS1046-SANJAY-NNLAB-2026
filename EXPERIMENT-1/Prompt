WAP to visualize the Perceptron Learning Algorithm using numpy and matplotlib/seaborn in Python.
Evaluate performance of a single perceptron for NAND and XOR truth tables as input dataset.

this is the experiment about understanding the perceptron learning . 
help me visualize the learning till convergence and plot all the necesary curves and
provide me the weights updation on each training loop.
